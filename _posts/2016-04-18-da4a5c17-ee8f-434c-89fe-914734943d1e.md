Charles Mendelson grew up just outside New York City and discovered the Pacific Northwest when he attended the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma. He graduated with a degree in English literature and a minor in theater. After college he focused his attention on acupuncture and attended the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine and the International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Vancouver. After Graduating in 2013, he started a software company to develop apps to help Type II Diabetics better manage their condition. Now that the project has wound down, he is back to his first love, treating patients.

Oftentimes we view health care as something done to us. At Generous Acupuncture we take a different approach. 

The emphasis at here is on the collaborative relationship between patient and provider. After most appointments Charles will give his patients "homework." Usually this "homework" takes the form of dietary recommendations, or other modest lifestyle changes. 

The other principle we take very seriously here is trust and credibility. There is a proverb "To a man with a hammer, every problem is a nail." Here at generous acupuncture we try to have a tool box, and if we don't have the right tool for a particular problem, we'll tell you. We don't sell anything to our patients other than acupuncture. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call the clinic phone number:
